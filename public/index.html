                I started my programming journey in 2020, where I got bored during
                pandemic and started exploring "no-code" game engines. My curiosity
                grew, and so as my mastery. It has been <span id="exp">4</span> years
                since I started. As of now, I have coded in about 12 programming 
                languages and created projects ranging from websites to games to operating systems.
