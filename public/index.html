                I started my programming journey in 2020, where I got bored during
                pandemic and started exploring "no-code" game engines. My curiosity
                grew, and so as my mastery. It has been <span id="exp">4</span> years
                since I started. As of now, I have coded in about 13 programming 
                languages and created projects ranging from websites to games to operating systems.

            <hr>
            <p>
                This is the 3rd iteration of my personal website. Work started in 2022,
                where I created the first iteration. The main focus of it was just to have
                a website up. Here is some of the "remnants" of the first iteration:
            </p>
            <br>
            <a 
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220914091916/https://great-anaphylaxis.web.app/projects.html"
                target="_blank">
                Old website/projects.html
            </a>

            <a 
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220914092016/https://great-anaphylaxis.web.app/history.html"
                target="_blank">
                Old website/history.html
            </a>
            <br>

            <p>
                I started the second iteration of the website around February 2023. This time,
                it was significantly better than the first. Here it is:
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <a 
                href="https://great-anaphylaxis.web.app/"
                target="_blank">
                https://great-anaphylaxis.web.app/
            </a>
            <br>

            <p>
                Late April of 2024 when I started working on the third iteration, which is this.
                I figured out that why settle for a "low quality website" when you can create a
                new better one?
