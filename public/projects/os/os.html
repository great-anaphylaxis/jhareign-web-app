    <h1>Operating System by Jhareign Solidum (2022)</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        This is my attempt at creating my own operating system. It 
        is a 32 bit operating system with it's own bootloader. Note: 
        It has not been tested on real hardware so it MIGHT NOT WORK 
        ON REAL HARDWARE. But, it works on QEMU (a virtual machine).
    </p>
    <p>The project can be downloaded <a href="os.bin">here</a></p>
    <p>I use this to run the bin file</p>
    <pre>"C:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe" -soundhw pcspk,sb16 "os.bin"</pre>
    <p>The source code can be downloaded <a href="os.zip">here</a>. It is very messy though.</p>
